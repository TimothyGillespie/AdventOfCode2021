# Advent Of Code 2021
My solutions to the challenges of https://adventofcode.com/2021

The challenges how two parts, which is why you will usually find solution1 and solution2 named files for each part.
Each solution will also contain a ReadMe with instructions on how to run the program, the resource I used and sometimes
some thoughts of mine.

## [Day 1: Sonar Sweep](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/1)
First attempted with Scala, but I was unhappy with the architecture. So, I did it briefly in bash.

## [Day 2: Dive!](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/2)
I did this one in raw JavaScript with node. I only used node briefly in this way, and otherwise work a lot with TypeScript.

## [Day 3: Binary Diagnostic](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/3)
The programming language was Dart, as chosen by https://perchance.org/programming-languge.
It seems interesting, but I certainly really noticed how I am only skipping the actual language and don't gain any proper
insight into them, which is why I want to keep to languages familiar to me with the future tasks.
