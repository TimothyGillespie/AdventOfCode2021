# Advent Of Code 2021
My solutions to the challenges of https://adventofcode.com/2021

I may very well use the challenges to try other, different programming languages or approaches.


## [Day 1: Sonar Sweep](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/1)
First attempted with Scala, but I was unhappy with the architecture. So I did it briefly in bash.

##[Day 2: Dive!](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/2)
I did this one in raw JavaScript with node. I only used node briefly in this way and otherwise work a lot with TypeScript.
