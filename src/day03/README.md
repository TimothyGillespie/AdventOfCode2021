This time I decided to take a random language which was picked by
https://perchance.org/programming-languge

It picked Dart for me, which I have heard about and knew it was related to Google and Flutter, but not much more.

To run the program, you need to install dart:
https://dart.dev/get-dart

Then you can run the program with:
```
dart solution1.dart input.txt
dart solution2.dart input.txt
```

Dart seems quite interesting in some ways, but I really noticed that I am just skimping over
these new languages and don't really get a great insight. Which is why I will now focus more on languages I know.
