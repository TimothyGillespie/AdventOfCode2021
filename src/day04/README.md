Unfortunately, I was not able to figure out how to run a kotlin program in a simple way.

I first attempted to not use any build tool and various other infrastructure, 
however this lead to a terrible IDE experience and issues which I don't really understand.

In the end I opted to just embed it in a full, generated project setup. But probably won't be
using Kotlin further until I figured out how to get it running properly only with the 
`kotlinc` and the JavaVM.

Splitting the files for reuse only made it more difficult.
